## 🚀 About Me

I’m a beginner front-end developer with hands-on training in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and over a year of experience designing user-centric interfaces in Figma. I also bring 6+ months of off-page SEO experience, giving me a well-rounded understanding of how design and visibility work together on the web.

I'm always eager to learn, grow, and stay ahead of tech trends. Outside of coding, you'll find me playing volleyball, gaming (both PC and mobile), or exploring new foods and cultures.

Currently focused on improving JavaScript skills and transforming static designs into fully interactive websites.
